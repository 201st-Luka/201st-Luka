### Hello there, I'm 201st-Luka.

Hi, I'm 201st-Luka. I'm 19 years old and studying computer science at the University of Liège in Belgium (2nd Bachelor).   
I discovered that progamming is my passion when I was 16 years old and got my laptop. I started programming a Discord bot in Python.

#### My projects

At the moment I am developing a ClashOfClans Discord bot to manage and automate information and help me with statistics about the activity of my clan's members. This bot is called
[HeadhunterBot](https://github.com/201st-Luka/HeadhunterBot) and is still in developement and not ready for use yet. 

This Discord bot is also using my own ClashOfClans API wrapper ([PyClasher](https://github.com/201st-Luka/PyClasher)) which is availible on [PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/).

An other project is the [simulator for spectroscopic terms](https://github.com/201st-Luka/Sim4SpecTerms) (for the Chemistry students of my university). The project was firstly
written in C but had no graphical user interface (see [SimulatorForSpectroscopicTerms-C](https://github.com/201st-Luka/SimulatorForSpectroscopicTerms-C)). Earlier, this project used 
the old C source code, which I wrote, as a C Python extension. But now, the app uses a pure Python implementation and is even faster!

After random people joined my private Minecraft server, I started developing a Discord bot to help me keeping the whitelist up to date but this project is at a very eraly state and 
not even working correctly.
