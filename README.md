### Hello there, I'm 201st-Luka.

Hi, I'm 201st-Luka. I'm 18 years old and studying computer science at the University of Li√®ge in Belgium.   
I discovered that progamming is my passion when I was 16 years old and got my laptop. I started programming a Discord bot in Python.

#### My projects

At the moment I am developing a ClashOfClans Discord bot to manage and automate information and help me with statistics about the activity of my clan's members. This bot is called
[HeadhunterBot](https://github.com/201st-Luka/HeadhunterBot) and is still in developement and not ready for use yet. 

This Discord bot is also using my own ClashOfClans API wrapper ([PyClasher](https://github.com/201st-Luka/PyClasher)) which will be released on [PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/) soon
(after my exams).

An other project is the [simulator for spectroscopic terms](https://github.com/201st-Luka/Sim4SpecTerms) (for the Chemistry students of my university). The project was firstly
written in C but had no graphical user interface (see [SimulatorForSpectroscopicTerms-C](https://github.com/201st-Luka/SimulatorForSpectroscopicTerms-C)). The command line code
works on Ubuntu but writing this project with C has no future. That is why I am currently re-writing the project with Rust. This allows me to write OS independent code (I hope so).

#### My goals

- Releasing pyclasher v1.0.0 on PyPi
- Hosting the HeadhunterBot
- Doing some other cool stuff
- Releasing Sim4SpecTerms before october
