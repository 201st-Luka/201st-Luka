### Hi there, I'm 201st-Luka.

Hi, I'm 201st-Luka. I'm 18 years old and studying computer science.   
I discovered that progamming is my passion when I was 16 years old and got my laptop. I started programming a Discord bot in Python.

#### My projects

At the moment I'm writing a program in C for the chemisty students of my university. This program is a [simulator for spectroscopic terms](https://github.com/201st-Luka/SimulatorForSpectroscopicTerms). I put a lot of work into it. 
I had to understand the chemistry and math behind the process and then I could finally write an inplementation. The simulator is not ready at the moment but hopefully it will be in the future.

At the moment my Discord bot in Python is not in a public repository. Maybe it will be in the future.
